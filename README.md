# :love_letter: Luv Archives

Archive for 19th century luv correspondence  

This SPA is backed by:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [CRA](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

For state management I used React internals (customs hooks, effects etc.)

## Install and Run
In the root folder, run

```
npm i
npm start
```

You should be able to see the app running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
